# Hyperledger Fabric University Course 

## Syllabus Outline 

This file gives overviw about the syllabus for the course from the fundmental to the advance level. The syllabus is divided into three basic elements.

1. Blockchain.
2. Hyperledger Fabric.
3. Hyperledger Umbra.

These three elemnts are created in think that the student had never came across the blockchain thats why the elementry introduction for the blockchain is required without which the course cannot be proceded. 

The above three elements are further divided into the folowing parts for advancement.

### Blockchain
1. What is Blockchain.
2. Architecture of Blockchain. 
3. Cryptography.
4. Hashing.
5. Difference betwween hashing and encription. 
6. Nodes in Blockchain.
7. Digital Signature.
8. Smart Contract.
9. Different tools for Blockchain. 

### Outcome from the first element
