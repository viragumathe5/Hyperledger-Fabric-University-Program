# Hyperledger Fabric University Course

## Course Discription 

Hyperledger Fabric and other Hyperledger projects are being incorporated in to research and education in universities more and more all over the world. Hyperledger can aid the growth by preparing study materials, sample lab experiments and quizzes and tests that teach computer science students about distributed systems and consensus algorithms and cryptography. Hyperledger Umbra has streamlined the process of setting up a full Hyperledger Fabric network running on a single computer. It provides an ideal environment for students to learn Hyperledger Fabric administration as well as use it for running lab experiments and learning exercises.

## Course Outline 

For the better designing of the course the course is subdivided into following elemets 
1. Course Designing
2. Writing Syllabus
3. Delivering the Content

For better delivering the course content each of the elements are divided into some parameters 

### Course Designing 
1. Principles
2. Who are the Students
3. Constraints in course
4. Objective of studies
5. Assessment and its different types
6. Instruction strategies
7. Course content and Schedule

### Writing Syllabus
1. Writing syllabus for the new course
2. Revise the new syllabus
3. Continuously improving the syllabus
4. Objectives
5. Deliverables of the course

### Delivering the content
1. Instructional Strategies (Notes, Videos, Self discussion labs, etc)
2. Problematic student feedback
3. Student support system

## After the completion of the project the expected outcome would be 
1. The construction of a classroom-in-a-box that introduces core concepts of distributed systems and algorithms using Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Umbra as the example systems.
2. A report on the process of designing and implementing the course material.


## Material Required for the Project
1. Educational Materials
2. Quizzes
3. Lab material
